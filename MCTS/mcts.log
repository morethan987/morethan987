 Ooooh, numbers and discounts! *giggles* Okay, first let's count how many tickets Mr. Benson bought that were over 10 because that's when the discount starts! He bought 12 tickets, and 12 is bigger than 10 by... *counts on fingers*... 2 tickets! Yay! So the discount applies to 2 tickets! *happy dance*

 Alright, let's tackle this step by step with a dash of humor to keep things light! 

**Step 1: Determine how many tickets qualify for the discount.**  
Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets, but the discount only kicks in for tickets *exceeding* 10. So, that's 12 - 10 = 2 tickets that get the 5% discount. 

*(Why did the extra tickets go to therapy? Because they felt discounted... in life.)*  

Now, who's next to calculate the actual savings?

 Let's break this down step by step. First, we need to determine how many tickets qualify for the 5% discount. Since the discount applies to every ticket bought that exceeds 10, and Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets, that means 2 tickets (12 - 10 = 2) qualify for the discount. 

Now, let's calculate the cost of the non-discounted tickets. That would be 10 tickets at $40 each. 

10 tickets * $40/ticket = $400. 

That's the first part of the total cost. Next step would be to calculate the cost of the discounted tickets.

Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets, but the discount only kicks in for tickets *exceeding* 10. So, that's 12 - 10 = 2 tickets that get the 5% discount. The other 10 are full priceâ€”no free lunch (or concert) for those!

 **Step 2: Calculate the discount amount per qualifying ticket.**  
Each of the 2 tickets exceeding 10 gets a 5% discount.  
5% of $40 = 0.05 * 40 = $2 discount per ticket.  

*Next, we'll determine the total discount for these tickets.*

 **Step 3: Calculate the total discount for all qualifying tickets.**  
We have 2 tickets each getting a $2 discount. So, 2 tickets * $2 discount = $4 total discount. That's enough for a fancy coffee... or half a concert snack!  

*Now, who's up for calculating the total cost before the discount?*

*Next, let's subtract the discount to find out what he actually paid. Who's got the final math?*

 Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step, but first, let me tell you a joke to lighten the mood! Why did the concert ticket go to therapy? Because it had too many issues! ðŸ˜„

Now, onto the problem. The first step is to figure out how many tickets Mr. Benson bought that qualify for the discount. He bought 12 tickets, and the discount applies to every ticket bought that exceeds 10. 

So, the number of tickets that qualify for the discount is 12 (total tickets) - 10 = 2 tickets. 

That means 2 tickets get the 5% discount, and the other 10 are at the regular price of $40 each. 

But wait, before we calculate, let me ask: is this discount like a "buy 10, get 2 at 5% off" deal? Because if so, that's a pretty sweet dealâ€”almost as sweet as getting a free backstage pass from a smitten ticket seller! ðŸ’˜

Now, let's move to the next step: calculating the cost of the 10 regular-priced tickets. That would be 10 tickets * $40 = $400. 

But hold on, we're not done yet! We still have those 2 discounted tickets to account for. The discount is 5% off each of those tickets. 

So, the discounted price per ticket is $40 - (5% of $40). 

Calculating 5% of $40: that's 0.05 * 40 = $2. 

Therefore, the discounted price per ticket is $40 - $2 = $38. 

Now, the cost for the 2 discounted tickets is 2 * $38 = $76. 

Finally, we add the cost of the regular tickets and the discounted tickets: $400 + $76 = $476. 

But wait, let me double-check that math because, as my grandma used to say, "A penny saved is a penny earned, but a miscalculation could leave you heartbrokenâ€”and penniless!" 

10 tickets at $40: 10 * 40 = 400. Correct. 
2 tickets at $38: 2 * 38 = 76. Correct. 
Total: 400 + 76 = 476. 

Yep, the math checks out! So, Mr. Benson paid a total of $476 for all 12 tickets.
